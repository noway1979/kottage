# Kottage
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/noway1979/kottage.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/noway1979/kottage)

Kottage is a JUnit 5 extension aimed at integration/component tests. It provides a pluggable component model that provides an API to any resource to integrate within tests. It supports a dynamic, hierarchical test configuration allowing to customize test resource configuration from global and host-specific settings down to specific overrides on a singular test.

Builds upon JUnit Jupiter 5, Typesafe Config and implemented in Kotlin.
